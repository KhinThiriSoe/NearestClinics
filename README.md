# NearestClinics
 
 The app is for my M.C.Sc (Thesis) project of [University of Computer Studies, Mandalay, Myanmar](http://www.ucsm.edu.mm/).
 
- can easily search clinics and doctors from the nearest location
- can make direct phone call to prefer clinic

What I've learned after thesis:
- how FindMe Retrieval algorithm works
- why Knowlegde-based Recommender Systems are useful
- how to apply algrothim in android app
- how content provider works with sqlite database
- how to measure performance of the app
